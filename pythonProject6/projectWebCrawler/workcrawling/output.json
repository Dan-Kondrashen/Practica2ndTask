With a focus on organic and scalable battlefield mobility, Pearson Engineering has released its latest product developments Threat-Sense and Threat-Pathway. Designed to provide military vehicles with capability to both detect and displace scatterable-mines, the unique systems have been developed to overcome the fatal challenges to mobility which were seen only a couple of years ago in the Donbass region of Ukraine and which present a rising threat to all military vehicles, both armoured and non-armoured. The systems are designed to be used together, or separately, dependent on existing capabilities and requirements from different nations. Threat-Sense, the detect component, uses artificial intelligence to identify surface laid threats.\n", "Deep learning algorithms developed by the company’s team of software engineers can detect anti-tank and anti-personnel mines and indicate to operators in varying environmental conditions where threats are present. Crucially, by analysing the insights provided by the system, the most viable route out of the threat can be found. The fully passive system simultaneously analyses video streams in real-time from visual and thermal cameras mounted on the vehicle. If any threats from a pre-programmed and trainable library are detected in either the visible or infrared spectrums, they are highlighted on a screen fitted within the vehicle and an audible warning is sounded. The Threat-Sense system serves as a tool to reduce the cognitive effort required of the operator without overriding human decision making, ultimately allowing them to take on a broader range of tasks to maintain battlefield advantage. Where no safe route is possible, Threat-Pathway, the displace component of the system, can be rapidly deployed from under-armour.", "Whilst more akin to a product from Pearson Engineering’s existing range of proven front-end equipment (FEE), Threat-Pathway has been developed to be carried by any military vehicle, rather than a dedicated engineer variant. Without impacting vehicle mobility, the new capability allows self-extraction from air delivered scatterable mines and supports freedom of manoeuvre when a minefield is encountered. At approximately 250kg for a typical IAV, Threat-Pathway is designed to be used in an urgent scenario where mobility has been stalled and independent manoeuvre is the only option. The equipment can be removed after use and is considered a life-saving consumable that can be easily replaced. With all military vehicles able to carry the system, it also serves to reduce the adversary’s expectation of how armed forces might be fixed by scatterable mine attacks. Further, the self-extraction capability will reduce reliance on engineer capable platforms and units and hence improve the doctrine of ‘march divided and fight united’. Threat-Pathway has been designed to provide full width clearance including at full steering lock and can follow ground contours in undulating terrain.\n", "\n"], "hyperlink": "https://militaryleak.com/2023/06/13/pearson-engineering-unveils-threat-sense-and-threat-pathway/"},

The Hybrid Aero-Effect Reducing Design with Realistic Optical Components, or HARDROC, team, consisting of personnel from AFRL’s Aerospace Systems Directorate here and Directed Energy Directorate at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, along with prime contractor MZA Associates, developed and tested a low-power, sub-scale beam director to evaluate the ability of various aerodynamic flow control techniques to mitigate optical and mechanical distortions imparted on a laser beam leaving an airborne platform travelling at high speeds.\n", "“Using advanced computational fluid dynamic, or CFD, simulation techniques, we were able to demonstrate significant reduction in aero-effects across a wide range of speeds and look angles. We effectively utilized a substantial amount of computational hours provided by the Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Office to establish which flow-control techniques could work, which techniques were worth pursuing and which were not,” said Dr. Scott Sherer, CFD lead for the HARDROC program.", "“The HARDROC beam director is a leap forward in technology to minimize aerodynamic degradations. This series of flight tests demonstrated the effectiveness of flow control to reduce the aerodynamic effects on the beam director,” said Rudy Johnson, HARDROC program manager.\n", "The flow-control at the heart of HARDROC has been in development for several years by researchers at AFRL. The Aerospace Systems Directorate team worked closely with their counterparts at the Directed Energy Directorate and leaned on previous efforts in beam director development to further the technology used in the HARDROC Program. While advanced flow-control techniques were at the heart of the HARDROC Program, tying these aerodynamic modifications in with realistic optical components was crucial to demonstrating overall system effectiveness. To get to these answers, AFRL contracted with MZA Associates, a world leader in the modeling, analysis, design, development, integration and testing of High Energy Laser, or HEL, and advanced optical systems to design a sub-scale system that could be either utilized in a wind-tunnel or on an aircraft.\n", "The resulting design was ground-tested in an environmental chamber as well as a wind-tunnel to ensure functionality and performance under load before culminating in flight-testing on a business jet during the summer and autumn of 2022. During the flight-tests, the aircraft cruised at high speed and a variety of sensors were used to measure aerodynamic disturbances. The data demonstrated that the HARDROC beam director enlarges the envelop that airborne directed energy systems can operate in, providing 360-degree field of regard across extended speed regimes with reduced size, weight and power, or SWaP, compared to other state-of-the-art turrets.

GA-ASI’s SeaGuardian is a maritime derivative of the MQ-9B SkyGuardian® and remains the first UAS that offers multi-domain Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Targeting (ISR&T) and has an internal payload suite that can prosecute surface and subsurface targets in support of Fleet Operations.\n", "During NE23, SeaGuardian provided real-time Maritime ISR&T data feeds to the various IPACOM operations centers including Pacific Fleet, Pacific Air Forces, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson Joint Exercise Control Group (JECG) and various exercise and real-world watch floors. Real-time sensor data – including Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), radar, and full-motion video – was Processed, Exploited and Disseminated (PED) by operators via Minotaur Mission System. The Minotaur system was developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. It links sensors, SIGINT, cameras, radar and communications equipment into a single, automated system that allows operators to more efficiently identify, track and target simultaneously with other users for expedited dynamic tasking. This classified data was transmitted to the Joint Fires Network using new DoD technologies allowing for the smart routing of communications between widely distributed communications nodes.", "In addition, SeaGuardian showcased an array of operational payloads, including Electronic Support Measures (ESM), Radar Moving Target Indication (MTI) and Inverse Synthetic-Aperture Radar (ISAR), Communication Intelligence (COMINT), Automatic Identification System (AIS), high-definition Electro-Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR) imaging system and Link 16. The ESM payload on SeaGuardian was supplied by Sierra Nevada Corporation and the COMINT payload was made by L3Harris Technologies. The aircraft featured the SeaVue Multi-role radar from Raytheon Technologies. GA-ASI’s Link 16 solution leveraged the L3Harris Small Tactical Terminal (STT) KOR-24A radio and Ultra Electronics Air Defense Systems Integrator (ADSI) host software ran on the Parry Labs Stellar Relay Common Compute Module. The GA-ASI-developed Detect and Avoid (DAA) system was also installed in SeaGuardian and received a limited certification from NAVAIR. This enabled SeaGuardian to perform beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) operations within the exercise airspace.\n", "SeaGuardian’s multi-domain capabilities allows it to flex from mission to mission and pass real-time sensor data directly to the fleet through Link 16 and satellite feeds to the shore-based command and intelligence centers. During NE23, the MQ-9B effectively passed ISR&T information to various surface and air units, and a litany of other U.S. and foreign units taking part in the exercise. In addition to its contributions to the exercise, the SeaGuardian self-deployed from GA-ASI’s Desert Horizon flight operations facility in El Mirage, Calif., to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, covering over 2,000 nautical miles in a single flight and demonstrated SeaGuardian’s unrivalled expeditionary attributes. The aircraft self-deployed back to El Mirage following the exercise. All flights were flown from a forward deployed Mission Command Element comprised of a Certified Ground Control Station and Mission Intelligence Station located Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, exercising UAS Expeditionary Concept of Operations (CONOPS) in support of Exercise objectives.\n", "General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), an affiliate of General Atomics, is a leading designer and manufacturer of proven, reliable remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) systems, radars, and electro-optic and related mission systems, including the Predator® RPA series and the Lynx® Multi-mode Radar.

The Squadron was initially designated for home defence, but was not issued with any aircraft until 13 April, when four Royal Aircraft Factory BE2Cs were transferred from 15 Reserve Squadron. During its 107-year history, the Squadron has operated across the globe and has been equipped with a number of different aircraft; in 1968 it became a C-130 Hercules Squadron, based at RAF Fairford, then moving shortly thereafter to RAF Lyneham. In 2011 No. 47 Squadron moved from RAF Lyneham to RAF Brize Norton, where it has continued to provide highly trained crews and support staff to support the MOD and by extension the United Kingdom’s requirements in the global theatre.
